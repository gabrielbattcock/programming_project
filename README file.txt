README file for HDS Programming course 2022


-- Project aim and overview --

    The aim of the project is to load two files into a script, merge them, perform some operations and to then 
    output the final data as an appropriate file. This has been conducted in both R and Python programming languages.
    The output files are  titled "births_output_r.csv", 'births_output_py.csv", "bweight_plot_r.pdf" and "bweight_plot_py.pdf", and they will 
    saved in the same directory as the source files.

-- How to read and run the scripts --

- R script -


    Check that the R script is in the same directory as the csv files titled "births.csv"  and "score.csv".

    The code should automatically set your working directory to the source location so that the files can be read in.

    Uncomment and run the install.packages() lines if you do not have tidyverse or ggplot2 installed. If this is not required,
    the code is ready to run.

- Python script - 

    As long as the python script is in the same directory as the csv files titled "births.csv"  and "score.csv", the 
    script is ready to run.
